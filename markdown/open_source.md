### Open Source

The Systems Metrics have been designed using _open-source_ principles with the aim of ensuring all data, code and documentation is accessible and made usable by the communities it is designed to serve. For this reason all guidelines are written in `markdown`/`RMarkdown` allowing for guides to be readily and flexibly adapted for different audiences and into a variety of formats including:

- Websites
- HTML documents / Word Documents
- Presentations (e.g. ioslides, reveal.js, PowerPoint)
- Jupyter/RMarkdown notebooks

The full code used to generate this workbook including all data used is availible on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/ewan-wakeman/SystemMetrics) and can be used as the starting point for any future analyses. If you have Git installe don your machine you can create a copy of this project by running the following command in terminal

```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/ewan-wakeman/SystemMetrics
```

In addition to this, all data used in the System Metrics is publicly accessible, and the source code needed to **access, compile, clean and present** this data is availible to anyone free of charge to **use, modify and distribute** as required. For those working in ICSs (both NHS and Non-NHS organisations), data is also made avaliable through the NHS Viewpoint platform ([part of the NHS Insights Platform][^1]) both in the form of interactive dashboards and an access point for downloding cleaned source level data for use in other analytical work.

The System Metrics will always seek to provide data in machine-readable formats (e.g. `.csv`, `.json`), accesible wherever possible through APIs, and published alongside the code needed to replicate any analysis.
