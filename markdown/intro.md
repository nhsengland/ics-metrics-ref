## Overview
This document gives an overview of the **Integrated Care System Metrics** (or **System Metrics** for short), a collection of measures which help to give an insight into the proess of integration within an Integrated Care System (hereafter referred to as ICS). These metrics were developed by the **System Insight and Analysis (SIA)** team within the **System Transformation** directorate of NHS England and Nhs Improvement. They are designed to give a _light overview_ the challenges facing the English health system and in particular ICSs, and open up avenues of enquiry for further exploration. They are **not** designed to be an _exhaustive_ list of all the things an ICS should be interested, nor as a tool for holding ICSs to account. Rather, the hope is that they serve as an entry point for ICSs to consider the challenges facing their health system and should naturally lead ICSs into further work in areas such as _Population Health Management (PHM)_. Crucially the System Metrics help to illustrate challenges that will liekly only be fixed through collaborative working between the multiple agencies and organisations working within an ICS.
