## Are systems working together more effectively?

#### Metrics
- System partnership effectiveness (TBD)
- Avoidable admissions
- Digital transformation (TBD)

#### Rationale
It is recognised that multi-agency working itself is crucial to the success of the ICSs to achieve their goals. These metrics focus on quantifying in some way how much of this change is happeninh within a system and in which places. `System partnership effectiveness` represents how well organisations are able to work with one another and will be a new metric which is currently uder development; it will focus on the relative ease or difficulty for different organisations to work with one another within the system. This will not be displayed as a single numeric value but rather a set of connections representing the strengh of relationships between different key parts of a system. `Digital Transformation`, also a new metric will look at the ability for those working within an organisation to access the information they need to do their job effectively. This will be set up to detect the outcome of digital transformation work, aiming to improve how data and information flows between different parts of a system. Again this will not necessarily be a single number but rather performance across a set of key *domains*. `Avoidable admissions` differs slightly to the other two metrics in this category and aims to capture unmet need, which often show as admissions in secondary care settings which could have been avoided. Whilst this almost certainly will not capture all *unmet need*, a reduction in avoidable admissions would be a strong indication that community health needs are being dealt with in the most appropriate settings effectively.
