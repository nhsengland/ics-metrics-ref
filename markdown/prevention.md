## Prevention

#### Metrics
- Percentage of physically active adults
- Childhood obesity

#### Rationale
As [life expectency in the UK continues to rise][1] more and more individuals will live for longer in ill-health unless advances are also seen in the amount and age to which population groups within England are able to remain healthy over the course of their life. This is a huge public health challenge and one which ICSs will focus on in years to come. The two metrics included within this section are two broad measures in two key areas which help to illustrate to what extent people within a system are practicing *healthy behaviours*. The `Percentage of physically active adults` help to give an overview of how adults within different geographical areas are maintiaining one such healthy behavious. Whilst other healthy behaviours could be identified for this group (such as smoking cessation) this measure captures something which *nearly all* if not *all* members of a population could do to improve thier health which is linked to other healthy behaviours such as the avoidance of excessive alcohol consumption or smoking and healthy eating. Whilst work can be done with adult groups to encourage such healthy behaviours, it's also recognised that healthy behaviours begin in childhood and as such `Childhood obesity` (in year 6) is also included which helps give a good picture of health in childhood cohorts as they transition from primary to secondary schools and from childhood to adolescence. Improvements in childhood health education should lead to improvements in this metric and over time carry through into the adult metric.

These metrics are included both to give an indication of how efforts in public health may be progressing in ICSs but also to maintain a focus on the benefits which can be realised long-term from coordination around such issues.
