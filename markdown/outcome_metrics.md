#### Metrics

- Healthy Life expectancy                                                                  
- Avoidable mortality under-75 due Cardiovascular disease                                  
- All cause age adjusted mortality rate                                                    
- The Integration Index (new, to be trailed in 20/21)                                    
- Proportion of adults in contact with secondary mental health services in paid employment 

#### Rationale
These metrics are predominantly focussed on *long-term* outcomes which will likely only be changed through *coordinated* work from partners across an Integrated Care System. They represent some *ultimate measures of success* for a system overall. They are things which can be changed in absolute terms (i.e. are not zero-sum such as 'position relative to a group average') over time and have the propensity affect either all or significant groups of people within a system. Changes in this domain will take time to show and as such measurements are typically taken less often. Progress against these metrics will represent improments in the functioning of an ICS overall and will likely be preceeded by changes in other areas of the System Metrics such as prevention or working together more effectively.
