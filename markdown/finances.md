## Financial efficiency 

#### Metrics
- Weighted per capita spend across primary care, secondary care and social care

#### Rationale
One of the major changes highlighted in the [NHS Long-Term plan][1] was the need to share budgets between organisations working together so resources could be more effectively funnelled to where they are most needed and to pen up greater opportunities for cross-organisation working. As part of this it, is recognised that the wy in which money is distributed between different parts of a ICS is crucial to understanding why certain parts of a system may be struggling. `weighted per capita spend across primary care, secondary care and social care` is designed to give a high level overview is being spent by a system and how this both *has* and *continues to* change over time.

This metric comprises:
- Secondary care spend per capita (£)
- Primary care spend per capita (£)
- Social Care spend per capita (£)
