It is recognised that the challenges facing Integrated Care Systems and the places and neighbourhoods from which they are formed are not uniform. Inequalities in outcomes are a persistent challenge facing the Health and Care sector as well as many other areas of public service. Tackling Health Inequalities is one of the core strategic aims of the NHS' Long Term Plan [^1] as well as other organisations and agencies who make up an ICS. As such, situating the System Metrics in the context of what we already know about such inequalities and what factors predispose particular communities to poorer or better health outcomes is essential to both understanding variation between systems, places and neighbourhoods and effectively planning interventions to tackle them.

The System metrics include a battery of indicators designed to assist with _understanding_ where health inequalities may be playing a role in different outcomes at a place or Neighbourhood level. These are presented in such a way as to help give context of the differences between parts of the system and to help identify where there may be a relataionship between the prevelance of a partcular demographic charateristic and health outcomes.

Whilst not strictily speaking metrics, the following indicators are included as part of the system metrics work:

- Indices of Multiple Deprivation
  - Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD)
  - Income Deprivation Domain
  - Employment Deprivation Domain
  - Education, Skills and Training Domain 
  - Health Deprivation and Disability Domain
  - Crime Domain
  - Barriers to Housing and Services Domain
  - Living Environment Deprivation Domain
  - Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index (IDACI)
  - Income Deprivation Affecting Older People Index (IDAOPI)
