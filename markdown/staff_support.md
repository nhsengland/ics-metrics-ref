## Are staff more supported and satisfied with their ability to provide high quality care?

#### Metrics
- Clinical, nursing and social care workforce per capita
- Staff supported to do role effectively (TBA)

#### Rationale
ICSs cannot achieve the goals they set out to without supported staff in the parts of the system where they are most needed. In recent years staffing levels have grown in some areas (such as Secondary Care) and remained stagnant in others (such as those employed in direct care roles with Adult Social Care). Whilst growth may largely reflect the amount of activity flowing through those areas, it is not necessarily the case that levels of staffing are most appropriate for the needs within a community. The `clinical, nursing and social care workforce per capita` is in fat a series of metrics which aim to show how staffing levels across sectors have varied over time and beteen different systems or parts of a System. 

This metric comprises: 
- `Secondary care doctors per capita`
- `Secondary care nurses per capita`
- `Primary care doctors (GPs) per capita`
- `Primary care nurses per capita`
- `Social care staff in direct care roles per capita`

It may be preferable in the future to also include a metric of `Staff supported to do their role effectively` giving an overview of how staff in different parts of ICS feel they are supported to do their job effectively. This may come as part of continuation to the **National Integration Index** work, or as a self-report measure delivered through existing staff surveys across a system.
