One of the factors in deciding whic metrics to include in the system metrics was whether there was historical data on how this metric had changed over time, prior to the inception of ICSs. Trends over time can tell us far more about what has happened in healthcare and the strengths / challenges facing healthcare across England. As it is recognised that no two parts of the country are the same, changes within an area over time are often a far more useful measure of meaningful change than  comparing an area to a national or regional benchmark, where differences could be simply to do with differences in the areas which make up an ICS or the populations they serve. It also gives us an indication of what **significant change** would look like by showing how much change is observed naturally from year to year. Time series helps to situate and anchor abstract data and understand more intuitively what changes are worth paying a lot of attention to.

Whilst some of the System Metrics re new and therefore dont yet have any historical data, regular data capture points will be gathered for each of them and used to construct a picture of how things change over time. This change is what ICSs are looking to make, and is a more useful thing to fous on than comparison to a national average or median.
